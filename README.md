## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Since I only had access to the starter files, I resized the desktop browser window to 1440px and the desktop-design.jpg to 100% in order to match the size as close as possible. 

### Continued development

It was relatively easy to copy the design. Although for the CSS, I'm not sure if there is a standard way to organize the properties (elements, IDs, classes, etc.)

### Useful resources

- [W3 School - CSS Rounded Borders](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border_rounded.asp) - This helped me to change the border radius for the div and image.
